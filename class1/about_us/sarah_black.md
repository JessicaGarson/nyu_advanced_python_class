Project manager; (crappy but overjoyed) dancer; (lazy) mma fighter; feels like she's writing a dating profile right now

## Motivation
My boss told me to, but also I wanted to. Got a lot of reporting that needs to be automated and no one else is going to do it for me.

## Area of interest
Not sure at the moment - I'll see what I can do with Python at my job and just sort of see where it takes me. I'm not looking to go into a new field, just looking to have more tools at my disposal to do my current job better.

## Fun Facts
1. I grew up in Rye, 45 minutes outside the city
2. I love to dance but in the ~26 years I've been doing it, I've never been very good
3. I would subsist on carbs, cheese, and burgers alone if it were possible
4. Gif not jif
5. I genuinely believe that seltzer is better than regular water

## Favorite movie
I hate this question. I don't have one favorite movie, it completely depends on my mood. But some that are in my list of favorites that I've recently watched are: Her, Bone Collector, The Avengers, Charlie's Angels, again, I have very wide tastes.

## Dream project
I don't have dreams.

Aka I just want to figure out the stuff I know I want to do, haven't thought much beyond that.
