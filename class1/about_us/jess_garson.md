# Jess Garson

I am a developer that just moved from Washington, DC. My interests include making crazy projects with code, planning hackathons, punk rock, and teaching others how to code.

## Motivation for Being Part of the Class
I'm always looking to become a better developer and teaching is one of the best ways to do that. I also really wanted to move to New York.

## Area of Interest
I like writing code for the web. Django is one of my favorites.

## Fun Facts
I have a python tattooed on my arm. Iâ€™m also a speed reader.

## Favorite Movie
Reality Bites.

## Dream Project
I want to learn how to make 8 bit games in Python
