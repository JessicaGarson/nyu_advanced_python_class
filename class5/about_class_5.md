# Class 5

This is a low key class where we are only going to focus on building our flask site. We will be deploying next week on Wednesday as a class. After class we'll be heading to HackNY together. 

# Agenda
We will be doing a quick stand up at the beginning of class and after that spending the entire class working on our flask site.
