# Class 3
This class will be mostly centered around flask. We will also start planning for our next class so we are ready to start building our site together as a class.

Slides are [here](http://jessicagarson.com/nyuap3/#/).

## Hello World
We'll get started with creating hello world flask apps.

## Live Code
We'll watch Jess make a very basic flask app.

## Flask Quickstart Tutorial
In pairs we're going create to work on [flask's official quickstart tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/)

## Sprint Planning
For the last hour of class we're going to do a sprint planning meeting that will include a brainstorming session and assign tickets to each member of class so that can build a flask site next class.

## How to Prep for Class 4
Make sure you feel comfortable with the tickets that you have assigned. Make sure you google or research anything you will need. Also brushing on flask basics would be helpful since there will be tickets in the ready column that will need to be grabbed.
